# Extra tools

## LLVM

`clang-format` is bundled under `tools/clang-format/` and must match the
version used to format the sources (currently 23.1.2) - even a minor mismatch
may reformat differently.

Other tools like `clang-tidy` are not bundled. You may provide them yourself.

### Linux build instructions

The official LLVM Linux release does not run on all target systems (for
example, older glibc distributions), so it can be built from source. The
example below uses Rocky 8.

Required software (may be incomplete):

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
sudo dnf install -y wget cmake ninja-build
```

```bash
wget https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/archive/refs/tags/llvmorg-23.1.2.tar.gz
tar xf llvmorg-23.1.2.tar.gz
cd llvm-project-llvmorg-23.1.2
cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja  \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" \
    -DLLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS="clang-format" \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/install" \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZLIB=OFF \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZSTD=OFF
ninja install-distribution
```

This takes a long time. Resulting binaries are in `llvm-project-llvmorg-23.1.2/install/bin` based on the original path when starting the build.
