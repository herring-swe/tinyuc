# Benchmarks

## Unicode Normalization

The normalization suite uses the [Unicode Normalization Test Suite 17.0.0](https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/NormalizationTest.txt) from UCD.
Differences between Unicode versions have not been considered but should be negligible.

We iterate the 20,034 cases for each of the source columns (source, NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD) and apply each normalization form.
In total 400,680 conversions per benchmark call.

Versions tested:
* TinyUC 0.4.0 (Unicode 17.0.0)
* utf8proc 2.12.0 (Unicode 18.0.0)
* ICU 
  * Windows: 72.1 (Windows Built-in, Unicode 15.1.0)
  * Fedora 42: 76.1 (Unicode 16.0.0)

All libraries are dynamically linked and tested against C-APIs.

Implementations compared:
- normalization — tinyuc_normalize (quick-check fast path).
- normalization-without-quickpath — tinyuc_normalize_full (control, always full algorithm, internal only).
- normalization-utf8proc — utf8proc_map with STABLE + COMPOSE/DECOMPOSE/COMPAT.
- normalization-icu — ICU C API unorm2_normalize with NFD/NFC/NFKD/NFKC instances; ICU is UTF-16, so this row includes the UTF-8→UTF-16→normalize→UTF-16→UTF-8 round trip. Not that fair, but since our philosophy is UTF-8 everywhere, this is what matters.

## Verdict

- TinyUC is faster than ICU on both Windows and Linux on this specific suite. The suite was not specifically chosen to beat anything.
- utf8proc seems penalized in lack of a quick normalization check. The core algorithm is fast (compare against normalization-without-quickpath).
- ICU is penalized since it expects UTF-16.
- This is before any targeted optimizations in the TinyUC library.

## Note on sizes

Size comparison may be interesting in embedding.

The TinyUC library includes case mapping, case folding and grapheme segmentation in addition to normalization.
ICU includes a lot more functionality than just normalization. The sizes here are only an indication and not investigated in full.

Windows:

| Binary | Size |
| --- | --- |
| tinyuc.dll | 353 KB |
| utf8proc.dll | 354 KB |
| icu.dll (System32) | 2.67 MB |
| icuuc.dll (System32) | 36 KB |

Note: icuuc.dll only forwards to icu.dll.

Linux:
