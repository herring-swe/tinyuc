# UCB

Probably stands for: Unified C Base
It may, or may not, have another hidden meaning.

## Goal

The goal of this C library is to abstract common platform specific functionality
and provide a unified interface for common operations on supported platforms.

Due to abstraction, it is impossible to be as performant as direct C implementation,
nor C++ templating libraries. Although it aims to be as performant as possible while keeping
a sane API for usage.

The design is to use [UTF-8 everywhere](https://utf8everywhere.org/), unless otherwise
specified.

## Target

- C11 for the core library
  - Supports calls from C++
  - Testing [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest)] use C++
- OS:
  - Windows
  - Linux
- Compilers:
  - MSVC
  - GCC
  - Clang
- Build systems:
  - CMake
  
See [dependencies](#dependencies) for exact versions.

Anything not listed above is not tested and is not a priority. Please help out if you want additional support and are able to maintain it.

## Features

- Simplified error handling
  - Handles errno/GetLastError() and converts values to a unified error code.
  - Non-trivial functions either:
    - Return an error code.
    - Return a result struct containing error code and the expected result.
    - Calls an optional user-defined abort function on fatal errors (for instance ucb_malloc).
- Memory management
  - Replacement for malloc/calloc/realloc/free
  - Optional memory tracking with manual leak detections.
    - Void macros for release builds to ensure optimal performance.
- New string type
  - Always UTF-8 encoded
  - Keep tracks of C string length.
  - Internally NULL terminated allows use with C functions.
  - Large set of string operations and convenience functions.
- Basic unicode support
  - Full Normalization (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD)
  - Case Folding
  - Case Mapping
  - Possibly adding support for switchable backend.
  - Collation may use system calls if available (not there yet)
- Threading
  - Threading and mutex
- Buffer helpers
- Filesystem
  - Lexical path abstraction, file/stream I/O and a portable filesystem API.
  - Queries (exists/kind/stat), copy, move, remove and directory iteration.
  - Optional extended helpers in the `_ex.h` companion headers.

## Minor Features

- Cross-platform C string function wrappers (like ucb_asprintf)
- Platform macros
- Utility macros

## Future plans

- Add more string operations
- Process launching
- Argument parsing
- Settings helper
- ???

## Limitations

- Locale agnostic
  - No plan for date or time functions (yet).
- Does not plan to be a full featured unicode library.
  - No plans for collation other than probably DUCET.
    - Use system calls if available.
  - Conversions to/from UTF-16/UTF-32 may be added later.
  - Currently expects UTF-8 on Linux and UTF-16 on Windows.
    - Use Windows APIs for conversions when needed.
- No plan for networking, JSON, XML or such utilities.
- No plan for GUI or graphics.
  - This is a console library only.

## Dependencies

This section needs verification.

- CMake 3.28 or later
- Python 3.6 or later (only for Unicode data generation scripts)

- MSVC:
  - The following are required for C11 support:
    - At least Visual Studio 2019 (v16.8)
  - At least Windows 10 SDK 10.0.20348.0
- Install python requirements:
  - python -m pip install -r tools/pyreq.txt

Development requirements (additional from above):

- Python 3.10 or later
- Install python requirements:
  - python -m pip install -r tools/pyreq-dev.txt
  
## Building

Simply use cmake.

Linux with GNU Make:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:herring-swe/ucb.git
mkdir ucb-build
cd ucb-build
cmake ../ucb -G "Unix Makefiles"
cmake --build .
```

For instance on Windows with Visual Studio 2022:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:herring-swe/ucb.git
mkdir ucb-build
cd ucb-build
cmake ../ucb -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Release
```

It is recommended to use Ninja.
